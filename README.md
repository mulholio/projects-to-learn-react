# Projects to Learn React

__A repo with what I think is the best and fastest way to become a React developer__

## Introduction

When I learned to code, I floundered when watching tutorials. I __felt__ like I was learning something but when I took off the training wheels and tried my own projects, I got stuck.

What worked much better (and landed me my first dev job) was to shake off the tutorial mindset and begin coding my own projects without guidelines. Specifically, I coded projects that were just one step harder than what I knew how to do already.

Coding is often uncomfortable. In fact, I'd think that being okay with discomfort is the one thing that you need to get right to be a developer. You will always be in a place where you don't know something. The trick is to know how to look it up, ask someone, or work around it.

You don't have to pick big projects. In fact, picking too big a project can be demoralising. You want the sweet spot where you don't know how to do the project in detail, but trust you could work it out.

## How to use this repo

1. Run through the Setup section to check that you have the required starting knowledge.
2. Read the projects list
3. Find the first interesting project that you don't know how to do
4. Implement that your project. Do not follow an exact tutorial in order to do so.
5. Publish your project on GitHub
6. (Optional) Get feedback from someone
7. Go back to 2 until you feel ready to be hired.

__Please make PRs for anything you find confusing or for your own Project suggestions.__
